# K-Means-Clustring-On-INCOME-Dataset
### On this notebook, we're gonna dive not so deep on the basics of how to dow a K-Means Clustering on a small example dataset. At the end of this study, I hope we could achieve the following understandings regarding our problem:
- What's a good way to segment our dataset on a small set of clusters?
- How can we achieve quick results using the Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pyplot and SKLearn modules?
- How the select the best hyperparameters for K-Means Clustering?
